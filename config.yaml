      I am a data scientist with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. I have a background in computer science and mathematics. I currently hold the position of a data scientist apprentice at [Dassault Systèmes SE](https://www.3ds.com/) in Vélizy-Villacoublay, France.

      I am currently working on a project that will help developers correct their code bugs automatically with AI (Large Language Models).

          I am currently working on a R&D project that aims to help developers correct their code bugs automatically with AI (Large Language Models).
          My missions are:
          - State of the art study on automatic code correction (using Deep Learning approaches)
          - Implementation of pipelines for massive data collection (Spark, HDFS, Hive ...)
          - Data exploration, analysis and pre-processing (e.g. change of representation using abstract syntax trees ...)
          - Development of machine learning models capable of proposing corrections (Seq2Seq, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers: GPT, BERT, T5 ...)
          - Evaluation, comparison and characterization of the models through tests performed on real production data
          - Integration of the models in our production DevOps chains (Web Service for IDE plugin)
          - Communication and presentation of the results in an innovative way for the customers
